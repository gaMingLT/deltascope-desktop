## Issues
- Release build CSS all broken
- Load time /timeline because of package size
- Timeline isn't loaded on pressing the ``get_events`` button
  - Need to click the modified, ... buttons for timeline to appear

## To implement - exists
- Files
  - Add name to file display
  - Clean up everything
- Add redux to react
- CLI Option for tool


## New Ideas
- Implement toggle for using wls for commands
- Select output directory
- Display done delta's 
  - select events from already done "cases"
